# Code Class

This is a **Streamlit** App that allows you to aggregrate multiples files of different formats in a unique big txt file.

The app helps you with providing context for llms and easily unifying multiple-files projects.

The app solves the problem of easily, quickly and more conveniently upload all code text as context for an LLM.

An example workflow:

You pass in the local path to a code project to the app -> You then select, if wanted, files to ignore -> You click on Generate the Aggregation -> Download a unique text file that you can easily upload or paste into Google AI Studio, ChatGPT or Claude, for example.
